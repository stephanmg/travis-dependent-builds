# travis-dependent-builds

Try to trigger downstream Travis projects from upstream Travis projects
hosted on Github with a miminum of cluttering your current `travis.yml`
configuration of the upstream project (see the prerequisites please).

This will also work if your upstream project belongs to a different
organization or user (inter-project/inter-organization build dependencies).
One needs to generate a Travis access token to use the Travis API, adding
the token to the upstream project, will enable to trigger downstream projects
which are owned by the user of the Travis access token.

Consider the following scenario (cf. figure below), i.e. the *DOWNSTREAM* 
projects depend on the *UPSTREAM* project and need to be build if the
*UPSTREAM* project was triggered by a new commit. Therefore we
can ensure, if the *UPSTREAM* project has changed and was tested
with success, that the dependent *DOWNSTREAM* projects are also
tested against the changes in the upstream project. This is to 
make sure that the changes in the *UPSTREAM* project  did really not
 harm the *DOWNSTREAM* projects by this given commit.

Please note, if a dependent project has been triggered by our
scripts, we log a message in the dependent Travis project (i. e.
triggered by upstream project with commit id 1c1234), to make it easy 
to find the commit of the *UPSTREAM* project which triggered the current
dependent project build and eventually made the *DOWNSTREAM* project fail.

## Usage
Consider you have an empty Python upstream project for now, e. g.:

```yml
language: 
   - python

python:
   - "2.6"

script:
   -
```

To trigger a downstream project (either your own or from a different user),
e. g. after success of testing, or in general after all your tests have been run, 
insert this snippet (note you can exchange *after_script* with for instance *after_success*, 
or anything you think should be appropriate for your usecase) into your `travis.yml`:

```yml
before_script:
   - gem install travis

after_script:
   - curl -LO https://raw.github.com/stephanmg/travis-dependent-builds/master/trigger.sh
   - chmod +x trigger.sh
   - ./trigger.sh stephanmg downstream master $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN 
```

This results in the following travis yml file:
```yml
language: 
   - python

python:
   - "2.6"

before_script:
   - gem install travis

script:
   -

after_script:
   - curl -LO https://raw.github.com/stephanmg/travis-dependent-builds/master/trigger.sh
   - chmod +x trigger.sh
   - ./trigger.sh stephanmg downstream master $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN 
```

### Explanation
The first curl statement, fetch the most recent version of the helper scripts
`trigger.sh` from the repository you are currently reading this README. 
The `chmod` makes the trigger.sh script executable.
The next line actually triggers a downstream project, termed *downstream*, 
of the github/travis user *stephanmg*, if the upstream project uses the 
master branch then a new build of the corresponding master branch of 
the downstream project will be scheduled. The TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN
is the environement variable actually is your github token which you are
supposed to provide in the corresponding downstream travis project you want
to trigger (cf. prerequisites below).

### Prerequisites

~~~1. Token
As a prerequisit you need to generate a TOKEN from Github's website,
e. g. go to your user profile, navigate to settings, generate an
as restrictive as possible TOKEN, and assign it a name, e. g. 
*TRAVIS*.~~~
1. Generate a Travis API token from here: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds
The Travis API access token can be added to the upstream project as an environment variable,
`TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Make sure you do not enable (Show value in build log in Travis settings)
2. Settings 
Next, navigate to your Travis projects, for instance if your user is
*stephanmg* (github/travis) and your project *downstream* then go to:
https://travis-ci.org/stephanmg/downstream/settings
There you need to define a variable, termed e. g. TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN
and assign the value of the TOKEN you generated previously. This variable
will be available in our `travis.yml` file by $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN.
This allows you to login passwordless in a e. g. shell script on the
travis build environment to your given downstream travis project,
and for instance trigger a new build (this could also be a downstream
project of a different user, if you know the variable which is used
for the TOKEN, e. g. could be different than TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN, and
the corresponding username and of course the repository name itself)
* Optionally specify a branch to use
* Optionally multiple trigger statements

In the *after_script* section you could then have a various of `trigger`
statements, e. g.:

```yml
after_script:
   - ./trigger.sh stephanmg downstream master $TRAVIS_ACCESS_TOKEN 
   - ./trigger.sh othergithubuser downstreamProject2 devel $OUR_AGREED_ACCESS_TOKEN_VAR
   - ./trigger ...
```

# Future enhancements on demand
* upstream and downstream project branch are assumed to be the same, this could be more
flexible, i. e. allow for different branches
* provide a configuration file for the `trigger.sh` script, i. e. reduce call in your
`travis.yml` file to `./trigger.sh --conf dependent-builds.yml`, i. e. storing all relevant
information in `dependent-builds.yml` file.

# Caveats
If you're using a build matrix for your *UPSTREAM* project, then for each entry
you end up with a triggered *DOWNSTREAM* project. There might be a workaround for
this in the future - or if included in the Travis API soon hopefully.
